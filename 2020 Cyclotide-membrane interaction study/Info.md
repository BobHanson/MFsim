# Cyclotide/Membrane Interaction Study (2020)

This folder contains MFsim job input definitions for a cyclotide/membrane interaction simulation study which is currently under scientific review (additional information will be available soon). 

A ZIP file comprises a MFsim workspce folder with a *JobInputs* and a *JobResults* subfolder pair: 

- *Single cyclotide.zip* - job input definitions for single cyclotide simulations
- *Single membrane.zip* - job input definitions for single bilayer membrane simulations
- *Two membranes - kB1.zip*, *Two membranes - cO2.zip* and *Two membranes - kB1 and cO2.zip* - job input definitions for cyclotide/bilayer membrane sandwich simulations for cylcotides Kalata B1 (kB1), Cycloviolacin O2 (cO2) and their mixtures.
- *Two membranes.zip* - job input definitions for systems with two bilayer membranes including a water compartment

To view or (re)use the job input definitions, download and extract the contents of a ZIP file to a desired location and set the MFsim workspace preference **Preferences/Directories/MFsim workspace** via MFsim menu entry **Application/Preferences/Edit** accordingly (a MFsim workspace directory is the folder directly above a *JobInputs* and *JobResults* subfolder pair).
